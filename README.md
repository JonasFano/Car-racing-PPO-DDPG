# Car_racing_PPO_DDPG

This project was done in the Tools of Artificial Intelligence course of the Master's programme "Robot Systems - Advanced Robotics Technology" at the University of Southern Denmark (SDU).

It includes a PPO algorithm optimized for training an reinforcement learning agent to navigate through the Gymnasium Car-Racing environment. Most implementation and parameter choices are based on the implementation of Ma, X. The corresponding link to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/xtma/pytorch_car_caring/tree/master (Link last updated on 01/06/2024).

Additionally, it uses DDPG from the Stable-Baselines3 library to train an agent for comparison.

The documentation of this project was submitted to the university on 01/06/2024 in form of a report.
